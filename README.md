TS3 Top10 script count the online time for every ts3 user on your server
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script consists of two parts:

- part 1 is a perl script that runs every 5 minutes an fill a database with the actual player names

- part 2 is a php file, that access the database an show a table with every known ts3 user and the ts3 online time from this user

HINTS:
- call the perl script every 5 minutes or modify the files is you want other timespans
- the php file is not my own work, just copy and paste parts - feel free to create eye candy here ;)
